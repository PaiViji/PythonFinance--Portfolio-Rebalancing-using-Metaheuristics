However, it is not a one-time deal since market forces tend to fluctuate and a portfolio kept **untended** for long can drift to a state that incurs exposure to more risk,  which is not in sync with the investor's risk appetite and investment preferences. Hence the need to **rebalance** a portfolio. \n",

    "\n",
    "Using the rebalanced weights $\\bar{X}$ represented by population P,  fitness function values are computed employing the penalized objective function described by equation (8). \n",

    "Obtain its offspring population by applying the genetic inheritance operators of *arithmetic variable point cross over* and *real  number uniform mutation*.\n",

    " This work demonstrates how a metaheuristic strategy (ES HOF) is able to obtain optimal rebalanced portfolios. An S&P BSE200 equity portfolio invested on April 02, 2019 and kept untended up till June 01, 2020 due to the pandemic,  was rebalanced on June 02, 2020. Again, the rebalanced portfolio was kept untended up till Jan 26, 2021 and rebalanced again on Jan 27, 2021. It can be observed that ES HOF was able to obtain optimal rebalanced portfolios that satisfied all the constraints imposed on it by the investor. The buy/sell/hold decisions put forth by ES HOF satisfied their respective constraints and the risk of the rebalanced portfolio did not exceed that of the original portfolio as well.\n",
