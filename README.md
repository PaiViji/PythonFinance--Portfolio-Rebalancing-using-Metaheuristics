# PythonFinance--Portfolio-Rebalancing-using-Metaheuristics
Rebalancing a portfolio with optimal buy/sell/hold decisions using Metaheuristics.


The objective is to rebalance an existing portfolio with optimal buy/sell/hold  decisions so as to obtain a rebalanced portfolio with maximal Sharpe Ratio, one that  is self financing and whose risk does not exceed that of the original portfolio's. 
A metaheuristic algorithm, viz., Evolution Strategy with Hall of Fame (ES HOF) has been evolved to obtain the optimal rebalanced portfolio. 
The portfolio rebalancing model has been demonstrated over an equity portfolio of 30 assets invested in S&P BSE200 index (Bombay Stock Exchange, India) during April 02, 2019 and kept untended up till June 01, 2020 before rebalancing it on June 02, 2020.
